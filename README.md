# NeurolucidaXML

NeurolucidaXML will be a JavaScript library to parse data from Neurolucida XML files. I just start with this project, so it is far away from being complete.

## Installation

For now, just install it manually:
```
<script src="lib/neurolucida-xml.js"></script>
```
or
```
<script src="lib/neurolucida-xml.min.js"></script>
```

Installation via npm is coming soon.
